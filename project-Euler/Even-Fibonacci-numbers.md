#### Project Euler: Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```javascript
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
 let a=2,b=3,c=0,ans=0;
 while(a<n){
c = a+b
if(a%2 === 0) ans+=a
a=b
b=c
 }
  return ans;
}
console.log(fiboEvenSum(10));

```
